# Machine-Learning-Notes
 A complete and structured collection of machine learning notes covering theory, algorithms, metrics, and practical implementation with Python.

# 📘 ML Theory and Practice

**ML Theory and Practice** is a comprehensive and structured collection of notes covering all major aspects of Machine Learning. Designed for students, professionals, and self-learners, this repository combines theoretical foundations with practical insights into how machine learning models are built, trained, evaluated, and deployed.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a single go-to resource for understanding the **complete ML pipeline**, from the basics of data preprocessing to model selection, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. It breaks down each stage with concise definitions, mathematical formulations, and implementation details using Python and popular libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `joblib`.

Whether you’re preparing for a machine learning interview, studying for exams, or building your own ML projects, this repo provides:

- 📚 Clear explanations of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning algorithms
- 🧮 Mathematical intuition behind models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs, and K-Means
- 🔧 Step-by-step coverage of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering
- 🛠️ A practical approach to training, evaluating, and saving machine learning models
- ⚙️ Introduction to hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Randomized Search
- 🚀 Guide to model deployment using Joblib and FastAPI

The content is organized in **Markdown format**, making it readable, shareable, and easy to navigate. It is suitable for use in Jupyter Notebooks, documentation sites, or GitHub Pages.

By combining both theory and real-world practices, this repository acts as a strong foundation for mastering machine learning and understanding the "why" behind the "how."
