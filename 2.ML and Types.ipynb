    "\n",
    "1.**Data Input**: \n",
    "- Machine needs data like text, images or numbers to analyze.\n",
    "- Good quality and enough quantity of data are important for effective learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.**Algorithms**:\n",
    "- Algorithms are mathematical methods that help the machine find patterns in data.\n",
    "-  Different algorithms help different tasks such as classification or regression.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3.**Model Training**:\n",
    "- During training, the machine adjusts its internal settings to better predict outcomes.\n",
    "- It learns by reducing the difference between its predictions and actual results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.**Feedback Loop**:\n",
    "- Machine compares its predictions with true outcomes and uses this feedback to correct errors.\n",
    "- Techniques like gradient descent help it update and improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.**Experience and Iteration**:\n",
    "- Machine repeats training many times with data helps in refining its predictions with each pass, more data and iterations improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.**Evaluation and Generalization**:\n",
    "- Model is tested on unseen data to ensure it performs well on real-world tasks.\n",
